2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone ##TODO: ADD LINK 
```
Navigate to the project:
```bash
cd unioulu-ips-community-app
```

---


### 2. Install and Set Up Appwrite (Self-Hosted)

We are using a self-hosted **Appwrite** instance. Follow the steps below to set up **Appwrite** on your machine using Docker.

#### Docker Installation

* **Docker CLI**: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). We recommend using the desktop version.

#### Run the Appwrite Server

Copy the appwrite env file from https://appwrite.io/install/env and place it in the appwrite folder with name `.env`. 

Fill out the SMTP variables in the `.env` file with the the following instructions. First you need to have a Google account. (Might also work with other systems, but we recommend Google)

#### Googles end

1. Follow this link [Google account security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) and login if needed. 
2. From there enable 2FA.
3. Then navigate to home from the menu on the left.
4. From there search for *Application passwords* and navigate to there.
5. Create a application password and copy it 

For more help in creating the password check [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/MkLX85XU5rU?si=ofN-pIZRj_SOuFaK)

```bash
_APP_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
_APP_SMTP_PORT=587
_APP_SMTP_SECURE=tls
_APP_SMTP_USERNAME=your.email.address@gmail.com
_APP_SMTP_PASSWORD=password-you-just-created
```

If you do not want to use Docker Compose, the appwrite docs have a guide for other methods: https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting

After installing Docker, navigate to appwrite folder in terminal and run the following command to start the Appwrite server:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
For detailed instructions, refer to the [Appwrite self-hosting documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting) or watch the [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/aO4mw8smXkI?si=8qp5IWHNkY-74J5v).

#### Setting up Appwrite

Once the server is up and running, you can access the Appwrite dashboard at `http://localhost` in your browser. You will be prompted to create an account and set up your project.

You need to register a new account, create a new organization, add a platform and create a new project. Once the project is created, you will need to create an API key that you will use to interact with the Appwrite API.

Adding a bucket through the Storage section is optional, but is needed to add new events in admin role. You can name the bucket anything you like, but make sure to update the `APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID` in your `.env` file accordingly. Don't create database yet, because later on a script(appwrite_init.py) does it automatically with some tables included.

In order to view event poster photos while using the app, you must set bucket settings so that anyone has permission to read.

To enable the email verification you need a google account. You also need to fill out some settings in Appwrite console. Instructions to these can be found below. 

Add these to the end of your `.env` file:
```bash
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key  # This will be created next and is found at appwrite console at localhost
APPWRITE_URL=http://localhost/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id  # After you create a project, project id is found at appwrite console at localhost.
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=community
APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=bucket  
```

#### Creating an API Key

You can create an API key by following these steps:

1. Go to the Appwrite Overview dashboard.
2. Under "Integrate with your server" select "API key".
3. Select a name and an expiry date.
4. Select scopes; for development purposes, you can select all scopes.
5. Click "Create" to generate the API key.
6. Copy the API key and add it to your project's appwrite `.env` file.  !!!FIX ME!!!

#### Adding a Platform

Appwrite requires you to add a platform to your project for CORS. You can add a platform by following these steps:

1. Go to the Appwrite Overview dashboard.
2. Under "Integrations" select "Add platform".
3. Select the platform type (e.g., Flutter app).
4. Select the correct platform and fill out the details (the package name should be the same as your Flutter app's package name. Current name is "community" and it is defined in pubspec.yaml).
5. Click through the optional steps and press "Go to dashboard".

#### Enabling SMTP for email verification

1. Go to the Appwrite Overview dashboard.
2. Navigate to the settings in bottom left corner.
3. Navigate to SMTP and fill out the information:
    1. Sender name: *WeConnect*
    2. Sender email, Reply to and Username: *The email address used in previous steps*
    3. Server host: *smtp.gmail.com*
    4. Server port: *587*
    5. Password: *The one created on the [Googles end](####Googles-end)*

#### Appwrite configuration with appwrite_init.py

To automate the Appwrite configuration process, we have provided a Python script (appwrite_init.py) that sets up the necessary collections and attributes in your Appwrite database.

Start with installing requirements:  
!!! FIRST CHANGE THE APPWRITE VERSION IN THE REQUIREMENTS.TXT TO 1.2.0 !!! It was changed to 3.0.0 so Dependabot would not alert.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure you have filled the required fields in the .env file. Then run the script:

```bash
python appwrite_init.py
```

This script creates necessary collections and attributes for your Appwrite database, including collections like:

- **Events**
- **Topics**
- **Posts**
- **Comments**
- **Announcements**

For each collection, it defines the necessary attributes (e.g., title, content, datetime, etc.) and injects sample data to get you started.

What the Script Creates
- **Collections**: Events, Topics, Posts, Comments, Announcements.
- **Attributes**: For each collection, attributes like title, content, dateTime, authorName, and more are created.

For example, the Events collection will include attributes like:
- **title_en**
- **location_en**
- **date**
- **time**
- **posterPhotoUrl**

This setup ensures that your database is structured correctly for the application to work smoothly.

### 3. Install Flutter

Once Appwrite is set up, the next step is to install **Flutter** on your machine. Follow the official Flutter installation guide for your operating system:

- **Flutter Installation Guide**: [Get Started with Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **YouTube Tutorial** for Windows: [Install Flutter on Windows](https://youtu.be/VFDbZk2xhO4?si=n3k9nqJ2sa8kIxi4)
- **YouTube Tutorial** for macOS: [Install Flutter on macOS](https://youtu.be/KdO9B_CZmzo?si=iYMvJ0ao_HHwKhfq)

#### Verify Installation

After installing Flutter, verify that Flutter and Dart have been installed successfully by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter doctor
```
This command will display any missing dependencies or issues that need to be resolved before proceeding. Make sure to resolve any issues if prompted.

---

### 4. Run the Application

First time running you must get the dependencies for the flutter using the following command:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Now, you can run the Flutter app on your preferred device or emulator. Ensure your device is connected or the emulator is running, then use the following command:


```bash
flutter run
```

#### On computer:
* You must have platform created on appwrite for computer's operating system. When you run the app, choose your operating system by inserting the correct number from the menu. This will build and launch the app on an emulator.
#### On mobile:
* First of all you must be on the same local network and the mobile device must be connected to your computer via cable (USB recommended).
* Now when running the app, it doesn't ask the number anymore, it should open the application on the mobile device automatically.

For further assistance with running or debugging the project, please refer to the official Flutter documentation or check the project's issue tracker on GitHub.

## 5. Local AI Assistant Setup (Ollama)

The project includes a **local AI assistant** that helps users explore:

• events  
• activities  
• announcements  
• community discussions  

The AI **does not manage courses or academic schedules**.

The AI architecture uses:

• Ollama (local LLM)  
• Python bridge server  
• Appwrite database data  

---

### Install Ollama

Download Ollama:

https://ollama.com/download

Verify installation:

```bash
ollama --version
```

---

### Download the AI Model

Download the lightweight model used in this project:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3.5:4b
```

Test the model:

```bash
ollama run qwen3.5:4b
```

Exit the model using:

```
Ctrl + D
```

---

### Create the AI Environment File

Create a file:

```
local_ai/.env
```

Add the following variables:

```env
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=community
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key

OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3.5:4b
OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/chat
```

Important:

• the API key must stay **server-side only**  
• never expose it inside Flutter code  

---

### Start the AI Server

Navigate to the AI folder:

```bash
cd local_ai
```

Run the server:

```bash
python ollama_server.py
